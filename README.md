- 👋 Hi, I’m @mvegas-flutterbots
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Flutter, mobile and app development, UX, language agnostic UI/UX, art, vinyl, and chess.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all there is to know about Flutter, Jitsi, some graphQL, Firebase, and video editing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Flutter and Jitsi projects.
